Hacking Guile-Cairo
===================

I use git as my versioning control system, http://git-scm.com/. It's
quite fun.

I'm currently in the process of moving to a hosting provider that
supports Git; for now the following instructions will work:

git clone http://wingolog.org/git/guile-cairo.git
cd guile-cairo
./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/guile-cairo && make && sudo make install

See the TODO file for pending tasks.
