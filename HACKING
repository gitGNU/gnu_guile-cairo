Hacking Guile-Cairo
===================

I use bazaar as my versioning control system, http://bazaar-vcs.org/.
It's quite easy.

Currently I'm unclear where to host the bzr archive; for now the
following instructions will work:

bzr get http://wingolog.org/bzr/guile-cairo
cd guile-cairo
./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/guile-cairo && make && sudo make install

See the TODO file for pending tasks.
