@deffn Function cairo-version  @result{}@tie{} (@var{ret}@tie{}@code{<int>})
Returns the version of the cairo library encoded in a single integer as per
CAIRO_VERSION_ENCODE. The encoding ensures that later versions compare greater
than earlier versions.

A run-time comparison to check that cairo's version is greater than or equal to
version X.Y.Z could be performed as follows:

@example 

if (cairo_version() >= CAIRO_VERSION_ENCODE(X,Y,Z)) @{...@}
@end example

See also @code{cairo-version-string} as well as the compile-time equivalents
@samp{CAIRO_VERSION} and @samp{CAIRO_VERSION_STRING}.

@table @var
@item ret
the encoded version.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function cairo-version-string  @result{}@tie{} (@var{ret}@tie{}@code{<char>})
Returns the version of the cairo library as a human-readable string of the form
"X.Y.Z".

See also @code{cairo-version} as well as the compile-time equivalents
@samp{CAIRO_VERSION_STRING} and @samp{CAIRO_VERSION}.

@table @var
@item ret
a string containing the version.

@end table
