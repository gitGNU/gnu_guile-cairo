@deffn Function cairo-copy-path ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} )   @result{} ( @var{ret}   @code{<cairo-path-t>} )
Creates a copy of the current path and returns it to the user as a
@code{<cairo-path-t>}. See @code{<cairo-path-data-t>} for hints on how to
iterate over the returned data structure.

This function will always return a valid pointer, but the result will have no
data (@samp{data==NULL} and @samp{num_data==0}), if either of the following
conditions hold:

@enumerate 
@item
If there is insufficient memory to copy the path. In this
    case @samp{path->status} will be set to
    @samp{CAIRO_STATUS_NO_MEMORY}.@item
If @var{cr} is already in an error state. In this case
   @samp{path->status} will contain the same status that
   would be returned by @code{cairo-status}.@end enumerate

In either case, @samp{path->status} will be set to @samp{CAIRO_STATUS_NO_MEMORY}
(regardless of what the error status in @var{cr} might have been).

@deffn Function cairo-copy-path-flat ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} )   @result{} ( @var{ret}   @code{<cairo-path-t>} )
Gets a flattened copy of the current path and returns it to the user as a
@code{<cairo-path-t>}. See @code{<cairo-path-data-t>} for hints on how to
iterate over the returned data structure.

This function is like @code{cairo-copy-path} except that any curves in the path
will be approximated with piecewise-linear approximations, (accurate to within
the current tolerance value). That is, the result is guaranteed to not have any
elements of type @samp{CAIRO_PATH_CURVE_TO} which will instead be replaced by a
series of @samp{CAIRO_PATH_LINE_TO} elements.

This function will always return a valid pointer, but the result will have no
data (@samp{data==NULL} and @samp{num_data==0}), if either of the following
conditions hold:

@enumerate 
@item
If there is insufficient memory to copy the path. In this
    case @samp{path->status} will be set to

@deffn Function cairo-append-path ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} ) ( @var{path}   @code{<cairo-path-t>} )
Append the @var{path} onto the current path. The @var{path} may be either the
return value from one of @code{cairo-copy-path} or @code{cairo-copy-path-flat}
or it may be constructed manually. See @code{<cairo-path-t>} for details on how
the path data structure should be initialized, and note that @samp{path->status}
must be initialized to @samp{CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS}.

Gets the current point of the current path, which is conceptually the final
point reached by the path so far.

The current point is returned in the user-space coordinate system. If there is
no defined current point then @var{x} and @var{y} will both be set to 0.0.

Most path construction functions alter the current point. See the following for
details on how they affect the current point:

@code{cairo-new-path}, @code{cairo-move-to}, @code{cairo-line-to},
@code{cairo-curve-to}, @code{cairo-arc}, @code{cairo-rel-move-to},

@deffn Function cairo-new-sub-path ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} )
Begin a new sub-path. Note that the existing path is not affected. After this
call there will be no current point.

In many cases, this call is not needed since new sub-paths are frequently
started with @code{cairo-move-to}.

A call to @code{cairo-new-sub-path} is particularly useful when beginning a new
sub-path with one of the @code{cairo-arc} calls. This makes things easier as it
is no longer necessary to manually compute the arc's initial coordinates for a
call to @code{cairo-move-to}.

@deffn Function cairo-close-path ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} )
Adds a line segment to the path from the current point to the beginning of the
current sub-path, (the most recent point passed to @code{cairo-move-to}), and
closes this sub-path. After this call the current point will be at the joined
endpoint of the sub-path.

The behavior of @code{cairo-close-path} is distinct from simply calling
@code{cairo-line-to} with the equivalent coordinate in the case of stroking.
When a closed sub-path is stroked, there are no caps on the ends of the
sub-path. Instead, there is a line join connecting the final and initial
segments of the sub-path.

If there is no current point before the call to cairo_close_path, this function
will have no effect.

Note: As of cairo version 1.2.4 any call to cairo_close_path will place an
explicit MOVE_TO element into the path immediately after the CLOSE_PATH element,
(which can be seen in @code{cairo-copy-path} for example). This can simplify
path processing in some cases as it may not be necessary to save the "last
move_to point" during processing as the MOVE_TO immediately after the CLOSE_PATH
will provide that point.

@deffn Function cairo-arc ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} ) ( @var{xc}   @code{<double>} ) ( @var{yc}   @code{<double>} ) ( @var{radius}   @code{<double>} ) ( @var{angle1}   @code{<double>} ) ( @var{angle2}   @code{<double>} )
Adds a circular arc of the given @var{radius} to the current path. The arc is
centered at (@var{xc}, @var{yc}), begins at @var{angle1} and proceeds in the
direction of increasing angles to end at @var{angle2}. If @var{angle2} is less
than @var{angle1} it will be progressively increased by 2*M_PI until it is
greater than @var{angle1}.

If there is a current point, an initial line segment will be added to the path
to connect the current point to the beginning of the arc.

Angles are measured in radians. An angle of 0.0 is in the direction of the
positive X axis (in user space). An angle of @samp{M_PI}/2.0 radians (90
degrees) is in the direction of the positive Y axis (in user space). Angles
increase in the direction from the positive X axis toward the positive Y axis.
So with the default transformation matrix, angles increase in a clockwise
direction.

(To convert from degrees to radians, use @samp{degrees * (M_PI / 180.)}.)

This function gives the arc in the direction of increasing angles; see
@code{cairo-arc-negative} to get the arc in the direction of decreasing angles.

The arc is circular in user space. To achieve an elliptical arc, you can scale
the current transformation matrix by different amounts in the X and Y
directions. For example, to draw an ellipse in the box given by @var{x},
@var{y}, @var{width}, @var{height}:

@example 

cairo_save (cr);
cairo_translate (cr, x + width / 2., y + height / 2.);
cairo_scale (cr, width / 2., height / 2.);
cairo_arc (cr, 0., 0., 1., 0., 2 * M_PI);
cairo_restore (cr);

Adds a circular arc of the given @var{radius} to the current path. The arc is
centered at (@var{xc}, @var{yc}), begins at @var{angle1} and proceeds in the
direction of decreasing angles to end at @var{angle2}. If @var{angle2} is
greater than @var{angle1} it will be progressively decreased by 2*M_PI until it

user-space coordinates. After this call the current point will be (@var{x},

If there is no current point before the call to @code{cairo-line-to} this

Adds a closed sub-path rectangle of the given size to the current path at

This function is logically equivalent to:

@deffn Function cairo-text-path ( @var{cr}   @code{<cairo-t>} ) ( @var{utf8}   @code{<char>} )
Adds closed paths for text to the current path. The generated path if filled,
achieves an effect similar to that of @code{cairo-show-text}.

Text conversion and positioning is done similar to @code{cairo-show-text}.

Like @code{cairo-show-text}, After this call the current point is moved to the
origin of where the next glyph would be placed in this same progression. That
is, the current point will be at the origin of the final glyph offset by its
advance values. This allows for chaining multiple calls to to
@code{cairo-text-path} without having to set current point in between.

NOTE: The @code{cairo-text-path} function call is part of what the cairo
designers call the "toy" text API. It is convenient for short demos and simple
programs, but it is not expected to be adequate for serious text-using
applications. See @code{cairo-glyph-path} for the "real" text path API in cairo.

Relative-coordinate version of @code{cairo-curve-to}. All offsets are relative

point to a point offset from the current point by (@var{dx3}, @var{dy3}), using
points offset by (@var{dx1}, @var{dy1}) and (@var{dx2}, @var{dy2}) as the
control points. After this call the current point will be offset by (@var{dx3},
@var{dy3}).

Given a current point of (x, y), cairo_rel_curve_to (@var{cr}, @var{dx1},
@var{dy1}, @var{dx2}, @var{dy2}, @var{dx3}, @var{dy3}) is logically equivalent
