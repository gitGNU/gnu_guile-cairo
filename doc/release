How
---
1) Stabilize everything, etc.

2) Re-autogen and make distcheck to make sure everything works.

3) Figure out the new version. Modify configure.ac to have the new
   version. Note there are two places that the version comes in.

4) Edit the NEWS file, using the ChangeLog as a starting point.
User-visible changes only.

5) Update the README if appropriate.

6) Commit with the new version and NEWS updates. Add a line to Changelog
   like:
   == Guile-Cairo XXX released ==

7) Re-autogen and make dist.

8) Would be nice to record the bzr revisions that the release was made
   with, but that doesn't seem possible.

9) Sign and upload tarball:
   gpg -b tarball
   scp tarball tarball.sig dl.sv.gnu.org:/releases/guile-cairo/

10) Make a release note, which should be like this:

I am pleased to announce that Guile-Cairo N.M.O has been released. It
may be obtained at:

  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/guile-cairo/guile-cairo-XXX.tar.gz
