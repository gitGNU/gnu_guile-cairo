@deffn Function cairo-svg-surface-create ( @var{filename}   @code{<char>} ) ( @var{width-in-points}   @code{<double>} ) ( @var{height-in-points}   @code{<double>} )   @result{} ( @var{ret}   @code{<cairo-surface-t>} )
Creates a SVG surface of the specified size in points to be written to
@var{filename}.

@table @var
@item filename
a filename for the SVG output (must be writable)

@item width-in-points
width of the surface, in points (1 point == 1/72.0 inch)

@item height-in-points
height of the surface, in points (1 point == 1/72.0 inch)

@item ret
a pointer to the newly created surface. The caller owns the surface and should
call cairo_surface_destroy when done with it. This function always returns a
valid pointer, but it will return a pointer to a "nil" surface if an error such
as out of memory occurs. You can use @code{cairo-surface-status} to check for
this.
