@deffn Function cairo-svg-surface-create  (@var{filename}@tie{}@code{<char>}) (@var{width-in-points}@tie{}@code{<double>}) (@var{height-in-points}@tie{}@code{<double>}) @result{}@tie{} (@var{ret}@tie{}@code{<cairo-surface-t>})
Creates a SVG surface of the specified size in points to be written to
@var{filename}.

@table @var
@item filename
a filename for the SVG output (must be writable)

@item width-in-points
width of the surface, in points (1 point == 1/72.0 inch)

@item height-in-points
height of the surface, in points (1 point == 1/72.0 inch)

@item ret
a pointer to the newly created surface. The caller owns the surface and
should call cairo_surface_destroy when done with it. This function
always returns a valid pointer, but it will return a pointer to a "nil"
surface if an error such as out of memory occurs. You can use
@code{cairo-surface-status} to check for this.
