Guile-Cairo NEWS


Guile-Cairo wraps the Cairo graphics library for Guile Scheme.


guile-cairo 1.9.90 -- 2011-04-23
================================

* Updated with support for Cairo 1.6, 1.8, and 1.10.  Documentation was
  updated as well.  This is a prerelease to shake out problems with the
  API.


guile-cairo 1.4.1 -- 2011-04-22
===============================

* Guile-Cairo has moved to git.  See the HACKING file for information on
  how to access Guile-Cairo.

* Guile-Cairo's license has been upgraded to the LGPL version 3 or
  later.  This should not cause problems for any users.  See
  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility for more
  information.


guile-cairo 1.4.0 -- 2007-07-28
===============================

* Guile-Cairo, like Cairo itself, now has a stable API and ABI. There
  will be no more incompatible changes made.

* Users may now contribute improvements to the generated documentation.
  See doc/README for more information.

* Some Scheme name typos fixed, after looking over the exported symbol
  list: cairo-image-surface-get-height, cairo-image-surface-get-stride,
  cairo-path-data-type-get-values.


guile-cairo 1.3.93 - 2007-07-17
===============================

* Guile-Cairo is now documented.

Documentation is available in PDF, HTML, Info, and online within Guile
via the help system.


guile-cairo 1.3.92 - 2007-06-12
===============================

* File output and input functions can now read from and write to Scheme
ports.

The convention is that the filename is an optional last argument, and
that if it is not given, output will be written to the current output
port, and likewise for input and the current input port.

For example:

  (with-output-to-file "/tmp/guile-cairo.png"
    (lambda () (cairo-surface-write-to-png surf)))


guile-cairo 1.3.91 -- 2007-06-08
================================

* Add backwards compatability to Cairo 1.2. Thanks to Steve Tell.

* Build fix for external projects using guile-cairo: header files now
  include everything they depend on.

* Bugfixes in vector type accessors and cairo-set-source-rgba.


guile-cairo 1.3.90 -- 2007-05-18
================================

* Initial release.
