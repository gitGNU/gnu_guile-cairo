Guile-Cairo NEWS


Guile-Cairo wraps the Cairo graphics library for Guile Scheme.


guile-cairo 1.3.92 - 2007-06-12
===============================

* File output and input functions can now read from and write to Scheme
ports.

The convention is that the filename is an optional last argument, and
that if it is not given, output will be written to the current output
port, and likewise for input and the current input port.

For example:

  (with-output-to-file "/tmp/guile-cairo.png"
    (lambda () (cairo-surface-write-to-png surf)))


guile-cairo 1.3.91 -- 2007-06-08
================================

* Add backwards compatability to Cairo 1.2. Thanks to Steve Tell.

* Build fix for external projects using guile-cairo: header files now
  include everything they depend on.

* Bugfixes in vector type accessors and cairo-set-source-rgba.


guile-cairo 1.3.90 -- 2007-05-18
================================

* Initial release.
