	* guile-cairo/guile-cairo.c: Define about 80 functions. Still not
	done.

	* guile-cairo/guile-cairo-smob-types.c
	(scm_cairo_font_options_equalp, scm_init_cairo_smob_types): Add
	equal? handler for font options.

	* Move C module and includes into guile-cairo dir; it seems I
	might have to fight bzr for this one.

	* cairo/guile-cairo-types.c: Some more types wrapped, time for
	sleep.
