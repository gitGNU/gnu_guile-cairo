* documentation (investigate munging the devhelp)
  - it seems doc snarfing is not a supported option; writing all those
    docs would suck, also
  - we follow the C API closely, prehaps we can munge the devhelp files
  - perhaps suckage is unavoidable
* examples and neat things
* stream functions, integration with guile ports; sucks because of exceptions
* think about points representation in path-fold; multiple value returns also.
